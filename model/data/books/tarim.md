Ḥabīb Muḥammad was born in the village of Mishṭah
near Tarīm in the year 1332 (1914) and was brought up
under the supervision of his noble father, the great scholar,
Ḥabīb Sālim. Ḥabīb Sālim taught his son the foundational
Islamic sciences and then took him to Tarīm to learn from the
city’s scholars. His teachers were the Imams of the time.
Among them were Ḥabīb `Abdullāh bin `Umar al-Shaṭirī,
Ḥabīb `Alawī bin `Abdullāh bin Shihāb and Ḥabīb `Alī bin `Abd
al-Raḥmān al-Mashhūr, his grandfather on his mother's side.
Ḥabīb Muḥammad also built a strong connection with the
knower of Allah, Ḥabīb Ja`far bin Aḥmad al-`Aydarūs. He took
knowledge from Ḥabīb Muḥammad bin Hādī al-Saqqāf in
Say’ūn and Ḥabīb Muṣṭafā bin Aḥmad al-Miḥḍār in
al-Qwayrah. He travelled on numerous occasions to the Ḥijāz
to take knowledge from its scholars, among them Shaykh
Muḥammad al-`Arabī al-Tabbānī, Sayyid `Alawī bin `Abbās
al-Mālikī, Sayyid Muḥammad Amīn Kutbī and Shaykh Ḥasan
al-Mashāṭ.
The extensive knowledge which he obtained led to his
appointment as Muftī of Ḥaḍramawt. His use of his time was
legendary. A day and a night would not pass except that he
had stood in prayer in the night, recited a large portion of the
Qur’ān, made abundant dhikr, taught his students, visited
someone, wrote something, issued a legal opinion and saw to
the needs of a Muslim. He would attend, in one day, up to
fourteen gatherings of knowledge and remembrance.
He had a great concern for conveying and preserving
sacred knowledge, and authored a number of works in
several sciences which are of great bene􀏐it to students. Among
them are Takmilah Zubdat al-Ḥadith in the law of inheritance,
al-Miftāḥ and al-Nuqūl al-Ṣiḥāḥ in the law of marriage and
Durūs al-Tawḥīd in tenets of faith. He wrote small books to
help beginners in the sciences of jurisprudence and grammar
and al-Tadhkirah aI-Ḥaḍramiyyah which covers all religious
knowledge that it is compulsory for women to know. He also
recorded in several volumes the speech of Ḥabīb `Alawī bin
Shihāb and wrote a biography of Ḥabīb `Abdullāh bin `Umar
al-Shāṭirī, Na􀏐ḥ al-Tīb al-`Ātirī. He composed a number of
poems as well as a beautiful Mawlid, named Al-Na􀏐ḥah
al-Wardiyyah which shows his intense love for and
connection to the Messenger of Allāh . He also put the
Mawlid of Imām Ibn Kathīr into verse.
He had a passion for calling people to Allāh and spreading
knowledge, expressed by his constant visits to the towns and
villages of Ḥaḍramawt. He journeyed to India and Pakistan
where he took knowledge from the Hadith scholars there,
among them Shaykh Muḥammad Yūsuf al-Kandahlawī,
author of Ḥayāt al-Ṣaḥābah. He visited Sudan and East Africa
and visited Ḥabīb `Umar bin Aḥmad bin Sumayṭ in the
Comoros Islands.
In 1387 (1967), a socialist government came to power in
South Yemen which attempted to eradicate Islam from
society. Scholars were persecuted and religious institutions,
such as the Ribāṭ of Tarīm, where Ḥabīb Muḥammad himself
studied, were forcibly closed. This did not, however, deter him
from exerting all his efforts in calling to Allāh. On a trip
to the Ḥijāz, he was advised not to return to Ḥaḍramawt as it
was clear that his life was in danger. He replied that the
Companions of the Messenger of Allāh had gone out
seeking martyrdom and that if it came to his own hometown,
he could not 􀏐lee from it. He duly returned to Tarīm and
continued his life’s work, speaking out fearlessly in the
defence of truth. He was required to register with the security
forces on a daily basis so that they could check on his
whereabouts. Thus, on Friday morning on 29th Dhū’l-Ḥijjah
1392 (1973) he left his son, Ḥabīb `Umar, then only nine years
of age, in the mosque before the Friday prayer and went to
register. He was never seen again.
