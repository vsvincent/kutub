# Welcome to Kutub!
We're an archive and study collaboration tool focused on various Islamic literary works.
The application is centered around the concept of intuitively linking together complex works in a comprehensive and customizable way.
Doing so will not only make it easier for beginners to quickly understand terms and definitions according to the Author they are reading, but it will also allow users to share information links outside of the core links offered by the app as well as contribute to core links offered by the app.
## Roadmap
This serves as a sort of priority list. Some things will remain outside of the scope of the project for the forseeable future. Including, but not limited to, pdf parsing for import, live collaboration, and pdf modification.
- Basic text linking
- Context linking (author, madhab, etc.)
- Users
- Per-user text editing
